Briefly summarize your client, Artemis Financial, and its software requirements. Who was the client? What issue did the company want you to address?
Artemis Financial is a company that creates different financial plans for customers to choose from according to their needs. The issue they want me to addres is to have good security for when the information is being transferred and to prevent unauthorized access to their data.

What did you do well when you found your client’s software security vulnerabilities? Why is it important to code securely? What value does software security add to a company’s overall well-being?
One thing I did well was not adding additional security vulnerabilities when adding a feature they requested. It is important to secure code because it can help prevent attacks that can allow unauthorized people to access the information. Having security will increase the company's value because it can tell customers that they have proper security when using their data.

Which part of the vulnerability assessment was challenging or helpful to you?
The most challenging part was figuring out what each vulnerability meant and what caused the vulnerability. The most helpful part was the top section where it showed the list of vulnerabilities in a short list.

How did you increase layers of security? In the future, what would you use to assess vulnerabilities and decide which mitigation techniques to use?
To increase layers of security, you can implement many features such as two-factor authentication and using secure dependencies with up-to-date security. In the future, using the vulnerability assessment to assess the vulnerabilities. This can be used to find what vulnerabilities there are, and it can help you find what causes the vulnerabilities.

How did you make certain the code and software application were functional and secure? After refactoring the code, how did you check to see whether you introduced new vulnerabilities?
To make sure that the code is secure and functional, I can first test the code to see if there are any errors so that I can make sure the code is functional. To find if it is secure, I can do a vulnerability assessment before and after can see if the vulnerabilities increased or stayed the same.

What resources, tools, or coding practices did you use that might be helpful in future assignments or tasks?
The vulnerability assessment can be useful in the future for assignments and tasks. This can help me make sure that if I were to use dependencies, it would be safe and without vulnerabilities.

Employers sometimes ask for examples of work that you have successfully completed to show your skills, knowledge, and experience. What might you show future employers from this assignment?
I can show my future employees my skills in finding vulnerabilities and how I have fixed them. I can do this by showing them the before and after vulnerability assessments which can show the vulnerabilities fixed.
